# Test Task 

Here is a set of test tasks serving as a first stage of the job application process. You may apply for the roles of a [system analyst](analyst.md) or [technical writer/DocOps specialist](docops.md). The tasks required for each of these two positions are marked correspondingly. You need to complete only the tasks and subtasks that are labeled for a role you are pursuing. 

You should submit your work via GitHub. If you do not want your work to be seen by others, consider creating your personal repository rather than forking this one. You may want to make it a private project (in this case, please add @xetres as a collaborator). The repository should contain separate files per each task. Naming convention for the files is task\<task number\> (e.g. `task1.md` or `task2.png`). 

## Task #1 
  
  `analyst` `tech writer/DocOps`

Copy the contents of the `ClearTH.md` file in this repository into the `task1.md` file in your personal repository. The file should be saved in the `main` branch of your repository.

Suggest a title for the text by creating a commit into a new branch of the same repository. Suggest improvements for the rest of the text in the `task1.md` file of **this new branch**. You can play around as much as you want: you might consider making edits related to formatting, language, content, structure, and even graphics. Additions, deletions, paraphrases are welcome - feel free to do whatever you think will make the text a better version of itself.

Once you are finished, create a pull request proposing to merge your commits into the `main` branch from the one you created for the edits. Don't merge the changes - just leave the PR open.

  `analyst` 

Suggest 3-5 questions that you could hypothetically ask about the solution described in the text.
  
## Task #2
  
  `analyst` `tech writer/DocOps`

Describe a business flow behind a [credit default swap](https://www.investopedia.com/articles/optioninvestor/08/cds.asp) in the form of a diagram (use the type of your choice).
  
## Task #3
  
  `tech writer/DocOps`

Write a summary of [this article](https://exactpro.com/ideas/white-papers/your-dapp-regulatory-grade) (80-100 words).

## Task #3
  
  `analyst`
  
Write a short paragraph explaining similarities and differences between the concepts 'API' and 'protocol'. Examples are a plus.

## Optional
  
If you have a portfolio showcasing your expertise with technical documentation, please share a link to it.
